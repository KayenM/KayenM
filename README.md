# Hey, I'm Kayen! 

I'm a fourth-year **Systems Design Engineering** student at the University of Waterloo (in the Great White North ðŸ¥¶). I'm a SWE Intern on Twitter's Compute team, where I'm learning to build **reliable** and **scalable** infrastructure.

I'm on the lookout for internships that will further challenge me. Please reach out to me at **kayen.mehta@uwaterloo.ca** if you'd like to work together. 

Looking forward to the next adventure! ðŸš€
