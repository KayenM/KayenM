ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kayen - a third-year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo

ðŸ‘€ I love building software. Whether it be creating fun games or long-term projects with more functional value, I love it! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve had some really fun and exciting internships in the past, which have made me fall in love with the craft.

Feel free to contact me at kayen.mehta@uwaterloo.ca!
