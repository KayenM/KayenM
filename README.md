ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kayen!

ðŸ‘€ I think tech can be so much fun. Whether it be creating silly games or long-term projects with more functional value, its super exciting for me! 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring more of full stack web development using HTML/CSS/JS, and I am also learning about data structures and algorithms using C++.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects all the time so feel free to contact me at k47mehta@uwaterloo.ca if you're interested!
