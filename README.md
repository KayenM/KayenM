ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kayen - a second-year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo!

ðŸ‘€ I love tech. Whether it be creating fun games or long-term projects with more functional value, I love it! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve had amazing internships at Scotiabank and Portable Intelligence this past year. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects, so feel free to contact me at k47mehta@uwaterloo.ca if you're interested!
